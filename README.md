# Segmentation from satellite images

## Description

Repository that implements a Deep Learning training using satellite images.

The following [article](https://apiquet.com/2023/12/15/land-cover-with-deep-learning-using-satellite-images_1_4/) explains:

* the MiniFrance land cover dataset,
* details about satellite data (TIF files, EPSG projections, etc.),
* how to visualize satellite data on Google Maps through the QGIS software,
* a description of the two satellites used Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2,
* how to get satellite images using Google Earth Engine.

## How to use the code

By running the train.ipynb on Colab using the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the readme.

Or by running the [train.ipynb](https://github.com/Apiquet/segmentation_from_satellite_images/blob/main/train.ipynb) or [train.py](https://github.com/Apiquet/segmentation_from_satellite_images/blob/main/train.py) on your own machine.
